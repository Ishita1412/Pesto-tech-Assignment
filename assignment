Ingestion of Data: 

Technology Stack: Because of its fault tolerance and scalability, Apache Kafka is a robust choice for real-time data intake. It is possible to construct distinct Kafka topics for bid requests (Avro), clicks/conversions (CSV), and ad impressions (JSON). 

Real-time Processing: Stream analysis can be used to continuously ingest and process data from Kafka topics.

Batch Processing: Using Apache Spark, batch operations can be scheduled to process data from file systems such as S3 or HDFS, particularly for historical data or enormous datasets. 

Data Processing: 

Standardisation and Enrichment: There might be inconsistencies in data that come from multiple places. Take advantage of data pipelines to standardise user IDs, transform timestamps in one format, and improve data with extra context from outside sources (e.g. geolocation information). 

Validation and Filtering: Using established standards (such as invalid user IDs or irrational click-through rates), apply data validation rules to find and eliminate invalid items. 

Deduplication: To remove identical impressions of ads or clicks, compression logic can be used in batch or streaming processing processes. 

Correlation: To understand the user path and campaign success, combine processed ad exposure data with clicks and conversion info based on a shared identity (e.g., user ID or campaign ID). 

Data Storage and Performance of Queries: 

Data Warehouse: For storing processed data, a data warehouse that includes Redshift by Amazon or Snowflake is a great choice. Due to their efficiency for analytical queries and aggregations, these warehouses make it easy to analyse campaign results properly. 

Partitioning and Denormalization: By separating tables relative to campaign ID or date, the warehouse's data can be further streamlined. Through the use of denormalization techniques, query performance can be enhanced and join needs can be decreased. 


Monitoring and Handling Errors: 

Data Quality Checks: In order to identify deviations (like sudden increases in impressions or absences of data points), integrate data quality checks into the processing pipelines. 



Alert System: Establish alerts to alert data engineers of possible problems, such as anomalies in the quality of the data or faults in the data pipeline. Use technologies such as Prometheus and Grafana to monitor metrics related to data quality and processes. 



Employ information lineage tracking to understand where data comes from and how it changes as it moves through the processing pipeline. It helps in identifying the source of mistakes and resolving problems with data quality. 




Extra Things to Consider: 

Security: To protect user data at each stage of data ingestion, processing, and storage, put strong security measures in place. For your data privacy, use encryption and access controls. 



Scalability: In order to deal with growing data volumes and user bases, the system should be built to scale horizontally. Scalability is improved by cloud-based solutions over on-premise infrastructure. 



Documentation: To guarantee maintainability and allow future enhancements, document the architecture of the data pipeline, the data processing procedures, and the data quality checks. 



By offering AdvertiseX a scalable and dependable data engineering solution, such an approach helps them manage and analyse their programmatic advertising data efficiently, which ultimately enhances campaign effectiveness and maximises return on investment (ROI).
